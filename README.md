# Emergency Android App
This app is meant to help people in cases of emergency.
The app will let you add emergency contacts, send them your location all at once, message them privately (sms or whatsapp),
turn on a siren to get peopleâ€™s attention and use the Check up on me feature to send your location when you are in danger and cannot send it yourself. 
It will also provide a list of emergency numbers like the red cross and the option to call them directly from the app.
